## Motivation for Project
<p align="left">
Heads Up is my senior project (in progress) that aims to lessen the amount of distraction related vehicle accidents. Assuming the phone is mounted in a location where it can see the driver's face, Heads Up will notify the driver with an audible alert if they are not paying attention. 
	
Presently Heads Up will notify a driver if they are sleepy, eyes are closed, face is turned away too far or they nod off. Curerntly the timer is set to notify after 2 seconds of being inattentive. However, this value is currently being studied to see how long is "too long" for a driver to be distracted.
